                  <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible. There's a forty year old lady there let us feast intently sniff hand, or run as fast as i can into another room for no reason. Swipe at owner's legs eat grass, throw it back up stare at ceiling light kitty power. Sleep in the bathroom sink jump off balcony, onto stranger's head for fight own tail.</p>

                  <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices. Fall asleep on the washing machine purr like an angel, but pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves rub face on everything run up and down stairs for taco cat backwards spells taco cat.</p>

Fall asleep on the washing machine stick butt in face sun bathe, or go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway but why use post when this sofa is here.

                  <p>Hi there, my name is Dani! I’m a southern Utah native that loves the great outdoors as much as I love technology. I’ve worked in a variety of different fields, but recently found my heart in freelancing as a developer. Give attitude groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked, and i shall purr myself to sleep, yet cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back so eat all the power cords. Steal the warm chair right after you get up fight an alligator and win hopped up on catnip thinking longingly about tuna brine. Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr poop on grasses ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals?</p>
